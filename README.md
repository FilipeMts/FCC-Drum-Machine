# freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Projects: Drum Machine

In late-2018 / early-2019 I went through freeCodeCampâ€™s Frontend curriculum while working full-time in a non-programming job. 

This was my take on the Drum Machine project: https://filipemts.github.io/FCC-Drum-Machine/

Tech used:
  - React
  - SASS
